# Exam take-home assignment for the course Operating and Distributed Systems at the University of Southern Denmark
My solution for the 2021 exam for the course Operating and Distributed System.
This solution utilized a Python Flask Web Server for the backend layer of the final solution for this assigment. The backend interacts with a Mysql database. The frontend is an Nginx proxy. The solution was combined in Docker Compose.
